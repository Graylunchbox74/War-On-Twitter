In order to run this game you will need to install ncurses.
Once Ncurses is installed - compile with: g++ Game.cpp -lncurses



This is a game I wrote to learn the ncurses library, It is a fairly simple game where you use "a" and "d" to move left or right and "w" to shoot, if a "#" reaches the bottom then you lose. The game also keeps track of high scores in a seperate file.
